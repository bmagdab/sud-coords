This thesis describes a corpus study on coordinate structures in English language. In the theoretical chapter I present four different approaches to annotating coordinations in dependency grammars and summarise the results of previous studies about coordinations in English. Additionally, I discuss two different dependency annotation schemes and provide my reasoning for choosing one of them over the other. Then I describe the process of training a neural parser to create the dependency annotation according to the chosen scheme as well as the process of extracting coordinations from dependency trees. Finally I present the results of evaluations of two parsing strategies based on two annotation schemes and the results of analysis of the coordinations found in the Corpus of Contemporary American English.
