# Extracting coordinations from SUD-annotated data

The repository contains code used for extracting coordinate structures from the Corpus of Contemporary American English annotated according to the Surface-syntactic Universal Dependencies annotation scheme.

The corpus study conducted using this code has been described in the Bachelor's thesis titled "Dependency structure of English coordination: a surface-syntactic approach" and in the paper "Symmetric Dependency Structure of Coordination: Crosslinguistic Arguments from Dependency Length Minimization" accepted to the Treebanks and Linguistic Theories 2024 conference.
